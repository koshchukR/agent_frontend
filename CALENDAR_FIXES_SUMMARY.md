# Calendar Fixes Summary

## Overview

Fixed multiple issues with the calendar booking system and added SMS confirmation functionality.

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### âœ… **1. SMS Confirmation After Booking**
**Issue**: No confirmation SMS sent after successful booking
**Solution**: Added SMS confirmation integration with backend endpoint

#### **Implementation Details:**
- **New Function**: `sendConfirmationSMS()` calls `/send-confirmation` endpoint
- **Candidate Data**: Fetches candidate info (name, phone, position) from database
- **API Integration**: Sends POST request with required fields
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of SMS failures without blocking booking

#### **API Payload:**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890", 
  "job_title": "Software Engineer",
  "datetime": "12/5/2024, 2:00:00 PM"
}
```

#### **Changes Made:**
- Added `candidateInfo` state to store candidate details
- Added `fetchCandidateInfo()` function to get candidate data
- Updated `handleBooking()` to call SMS confirmation
- Enhanced success notification to mention SMS confirmation

### âœ… **2. Calendar Availability Logic Bug**
**Issue**: Days showing as unavailable even when they have free time slots
**Solution**: Fixed availability logic to properly detect available days

#### **Root Cause:**
- Days were marked unavailable if ANY time slot was booked
- Past times for today were causing entire days to appear unavailable
- Inconsistent date formatting between slot generation and day checking

#### **Fixes Applied:**
- **Proper Availability Check**: Days are clickable if they're not past dates or weekends
- **Slot-Level Booking**: Only individual time slots are marked as booked, not entire days
- **Future Day Logic**: All future weekdays are clickable and show available times
- **Past Time Handling**: Only past times are filtered out, not entire days

### âœ… **3. Date Display Bug (Wrong Date Shown)**
**Issue**: Selecting day 5 shows booking for day 4
**Solution**: Fixed timezone-related date parsing issues

#### **Root Cause:**
- Using `toISOString()` caused timezone conversion issues
- Date objects were being created with UTC times
- Local dates were being interpreted as UTC dates

#### **Fixes Applied:**
- **Manual Date Formatting**: Create date strings without timezone conversion
- **Consistent Date Parsing**: Use same format throughout calendar
- **Local Date Logic**: Handle dates as local timezone dates
- **Fixed formatDate()**: Parse date strings manually to avoid timezone issues

#### **Date Formatting Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (timezone issues):
const dateStr = date.toISOString().split('T')[0];

// After (timezone-safe):
const dateStr = date.getFullYear() + '-' + 
               String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0') + '-' + 
               String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
```
